# How to compile on macOS
On macOS you don't need to install anything.

cc(1) is the (UNIX) `C Compiler`, as macOS is a UNIX compliant
operating system, it also have a cc(1) natively shipped with
the operating system.

cc(1) in macOS is the CLang compiler, which is a driver for a
collection of integrated tools for various stages of a compilation.
You can know more about CLang in the man pages `man cc`.

As CLang is a driver, it will complete a series of compilation
steps automatically and, unless an error shows up, will provide
you with an Mach-O file named "a.out".

# Running a C program on macOS
You just need to:

```
cc hello.c
```

CLang will do all the job and returns an executable (Mach-O).
Then you can execute it like:

```
./a.out
```

If an error occurs you might need to turn the file executable:

```
chmod -x a.out
./a.out
```
