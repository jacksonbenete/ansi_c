To test the word count (wc.c) program I should stablish some basic 
test cases, such as an empty file. Then, if there are 'if' statements
in our program it could be a good idea to test if those statements
are working.

- Empty file -> should return 0 0 0
- File without blanks, newlines and tabs -> should return 0 0 1
- File with newlines -> should return x, y, z
- File with tabs only -> should return 0, 0, x
- File with characters and tabs only -> 0, x, y

And so on...
